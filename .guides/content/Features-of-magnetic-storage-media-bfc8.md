## Capacity

- Ranges from 2 GB to over 1TB for an internal HDD 
- Ranges from 120Gb to 1TB for an  external HDD
- Ranges from 2TB to petabytes capacity for NAS used at organisations
- Ranges from 1TB to 8TB for NAS used at home
- Up to 1TB for magnetic tape

## Speed

- An internal hard disk speed is faster than an external hard disk speed.
- Slower than solid state disk speed.
- It takes time to access data from magnetic tape 

## Portability

- External hard disks are available in various sizes and are easily portable, however, some solid state media, such as a USB memory stick or memory card are smaller.  
- NAS is generally not portable.
- Magnetic tape is generally not portable 

## Durability

- If dropped a hard disk can be damaged.  It can also be damaged if subjected to strong magnetic fields or extreme heat.
- An external hard drive can be dropped, lost or stolen.
- If magnetic tape is placed near a strong magnetic field data can be corrupted.  Extreme heat can also damage it. Tape also has a limited lifespan.

## Reliability

- A hard disk is very reliable if it is not damaged.
- NAS is reliable if a network fails 
- A tape drive is required to read magnetic tape.  It is reliable as long as it is not damaged.

## Cost

- Relatively cheap, cheaper than solid state storage. 
- Magnetic tape is cheaper than hard disk storage, however, tape drives in large networks can cost £1,000 plus.
- NAS is lower cost than paying to store data online in cloud storage. Prices are decreasing and some cost a few hundred £s.
